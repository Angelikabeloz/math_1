## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
nums <- c(1, 6, 7, 8, 9)
nums [2]
nums [c(2, 3)]
nums [-1]
table(nums>5)
prop.table(table(nums>5))
```
```{r}
factorial(5)
choose(5,4)
sample(6,5, replace = TRUE)
sample(6,5, replace = FALSE)
sample(c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6), 5, replace = FALSE)
die <- 1:6
sample(x = die, size = 1, replace = FALSE)
sample(x = die, size = 2, replace = FALSE)
sample(x = die, size = 1, prob = NULL)
set.seed(125)
sample(c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6), 5, replace = FALSE)
sample(c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6), 5, replace = TRUE)
```
```{bash}
```

4. We will now learn how to run a simulation. Recall the birthday problem from class. We will simulate this to see if the mathematical result we showed in class holds up.
a. Set a seed for reproducibility.
b. Start by creating one simulated class of 35 people. We will need a vector of randomly sampled birthdays. Assume that all birthdays occur with equal probability and assume away leap years. You can just label the days of the year from 1 to 365.
c. Are there any repeat birthdays in your class? What are they?
d. Now we will walk step by step through running a simulation. In this simulation, we will randomly generate 100,000 fake classes and compute the average probability of having more than one of the same birthday in a class (the frequentist interpretation of probability). First, generate an empty vector called match of length 100,000 to hold our results.
e. Write a loop that generates a fake class and saves the number of repeated birthdays in that class into your empty vector.
f. Summarize that output vector: what proportion of simulated classes have matching birthdays?
g. Let’s compare our simulated result to the mathematical result from class (see slide 30). Compute the probability of matching birthdays using the formula we derived. (Note: the prod function may be helpful here.)
```{r}
set.seed
class_1 <- sample(365, 35, replace = TRUE)
length(unique(class_1))
duplicated(class_1)
sum(duplicated(class_1))
class[duplicated(class_1)]
n <- 100000
match <- rep(NA, n)
head(match)
for (i in 1:n) {
  class_1 <- sample(365, 35, replace = TRUE)
  match[i] <- sum(duplicated(class_1)) 
}
prop.table(table(match==0))
k <- 35
1 - 365!*(365-k+1)/365^k


```
```{r}
class sample(365, 35, replace = TRUE)
```
